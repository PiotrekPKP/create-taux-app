# Welcome to Create Taux App!

## What is this?

It's an easy-to-use, typesafe stack based on Rust (Tauri) and Next.js. It consists of:

- [Tauri](https://tauri.app/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [@shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

## Demo

<video width="1920" height="1080" autoplay="true" muted loop>
  <source src="/demo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

## But why would I want to use it?

It has two main benefits: the simplicity od creating UI and type safety.

1. The stack uses Next.js combined with @shadcn/ui which makes building iterfaces unbelievably quick.

2. The template includes typescript type generator (which runs automatically!) that generates types for react hooks. You can call your rust code without worrying about parsing the data!
